Shitty attempt at making wordle

Things I need to do:
-Make the virtual keyboard work
-Make the game reset when word is guessed (or not guessed)
-Fix keyboard resizing issue in CSS

Things I want to do:
-add a score counter
-add little "+1" animations next to the boxes for every point scored
-get a better word list

Things I should do:
-clean up some of the bulkier functions
-comment stuff
-actually learn how to use CSS and Front end Javascript



Keyboard issue ideas (intermediate problem):
-make a function that gets input from keyboard or virtual keyboard and return that value

Reset issue ideas (intermediate problem):
-create a seperate game state to store the original empty board in 
-figure out how to reset color of blocks and learn why animations aren't working after reset

Keyboard issue ideas (easy problem):
-Youtube or chatgpt
